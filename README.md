# bluster

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mthssdrbrg/bluster.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mthssdrbrg/bluster)

Bluster is a thin JRuby wrapper around Boundary's [Ordasity](https://github.com/boundary/ordasity), and it's purpose is
merely to make the API a bit friendlier for (J)Ruby developers.

## Usage

The [docs](https://github.com/boundary/ordasity) provided by Boundary are themselves well enough to get up and running,
even without the following example.

```ruby
require 'bluster'

class SimpleListener < Bluster::ClusterListener
  def joined(client)
    puts "Joined cluster!"
    puts "Got one of them ZooKeeper clients: #{client}"
  end

  def start_work(unit)
    puts "Woohoo! Claimed this one: #{unit}"
  end

  def shutdown_work(unit)
    puts "Booh! Shutting down this one: #{unit}"
  end

  def left
    puts 'Aww, bummer, leaving'
  end
end

cluster_options = {
  :hosts => 'localhost:2181',
  :zk_timeout => 5,
  :drain_time => 1,
  :rebalance_interval => 1,
}

cluster = Bluster.create_cluster('simple', SimpleListener.new, cluster_options)
cluster.join

sleep 3

cluster.shutdown
```

There is also a very similar example in `examples/simple.rb`, though it
should be mentioned that it requires the `zk` gem as well (which is included
as a development dependency in the gemspec).

The aim of the examples was actually to have a cluster with two listeners, but
JMX didn't seem to like it when I started two listeners with the same name on
the same host, and I don't really have the time to debug that right now, so a
single listener will have to do.

## Installation

```
gem install bluster
```

## Known issues and limitations

* It is not possible to override `#initialize` when subclassing one of the
  listener classes (`Bluster::ClusterListener`, `Bluster::SmartListener`).
  I'm not really sure _WHY_, but there's probably a good reason.
  Thinking about adding some kind of convenience method / option to circumvent this.
